## Lecture 03 - TailWidCSS

---

TailWindCSS : Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that provide predefined components and styles, Tailwind CSS provides low-level utility classes that let you build custom designs without writing any CSS.

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

[tailwind.config.js]

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
	content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"], // add
	theme: {
		extend: {},
	},
	plugins: [],
};
```

```

## Lecture 04 - React Router DOM & React Router DOM APIs

---

- What is 'React Router Dom'? - React Router DOM is a popular library used for handling routing in React applications. It allows developers to create single-page applications with navigation, and without the need to refresh the whole page.

- The React Router DOM allows you to implement dynamic routing in your web app. Unlike traditional routing architectures, where routing is handled in a configuration outside of the running app, the React Router DOM facilitates component-based routing based on the requirements of the app and platform.

- Because React is a Single Page Application (SPA), it has a single index.js template. Other components are added to this template using JavaScript to change the page.
  At this point, the React Router DOM library helps to route/navigate and render the new components.

* npm install react-router-dom
* <BrowserRouter>

[EXAMPLE]

```js
// App.js
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./Home";
import About from "./About";
import Contact from "./Contact";

function App() {
	return (
		<Router>
			<div>
				<Switch>
					<Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
					<Route path="/about" component={About} />
					<Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
				</Switch>
			</div>
		</Router>
	);
}

export default App;
```

- Components

* BrowserRouter: A router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
* Route: It renders some UI when its path matches the current URL.
* Switch: It renders the first child <Route> or <Redirect> that matches the location.

- Example Components

* Here are simple implementations for the Home, About, and Contact components
  [EXAMPLE]

```js
// Home.js
import React from 'react';

const Home = () => {
  return <h2>Home</h2>;
};

export default Home;

// About.js
import React from 'react';

const About = () => {
  return <h2>About</h2>;
};

export default About;

// Contact.js
import React from 'react';

const Contact = () => {
  return <h2>Contact</h2>;
};

export default Contact;

```

- Navigation

* To navigate between these routes, you can use the Link component
  [EXAMPME]

```js
// Navbar.js
import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Navbar = () => {
	return (
		<nav>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<Link to="/">Home</Link>
				</li>
				<li>
					<Link to="/about">About</Link>
				</li>
				<li>
					<Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</nav>
	);
};

export default Navbar;
```

- Routes :

* Container/parent role for all individual routes that will be created in the app.
* It will render the first matching Route among the child components created by Route.

- Route :

* Used to create a single route.
* It takes two attributes

1. path: Specifies the URL path of the desired component.
2. element/component: Specifies the component that should be rendered to match the path.

- Link: The Link component is similar to the anchor element (<a />) in HTML.

1. The to attribute specifies the path the link takes.

- Nested Routes : Nested routes are routes that are defined within the scope of another route. This allows you to have hierarchical routing structures.

[EXAMPME]

```js
// App.js
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./Home";
import About from "./About";
import Contact from "./Contact";
import Dashboard from "./Dashboard";

function App() {
	return (
		<Router>
			<Routes>
				<Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
				<Route path="about" element={<About />} />
				<Route path="contact" element={<Contact />} />
				<Route path="dashboard/*" element={<Dashboard />} />
			</Routes>
		</Router>
	);
}

export default App;
```

- Outlet : The <Outlet> component is used within a parent route to render the child routes.

[EXAMPLE]

```js
// Dashboard.js
import React from "react";
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

const Dashboard = () => {
	return (
		<div>
			<h2>Dashboard</h2>
			<Outlet />
		</div>
	);
};

export default Dashboard;
```

- useNavigate : The useNavigate hook is used to programmatically navigate to different routes within your application.

[EXAMPLE]

```js
import React from "react";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

const MyComponent = () => {
	const navigate = useNavigate();

	const handleClick = () => {
		// Navigate to a different route
		navigate("/dashboard");
	};

	return (
		<div>
			<h2>MyComponent</h2>
			<button onClick={handleClick}>Go to Dashboard</button>
		</div>
	);
};

export default MyComponent;
```

- useParams : The useParams hook allows you to access the parameters of the current route. For example, if your route is defined as /users/:id, you can use useParams to access the id parameter.

[EXAMPLE]

```js
import React from "react";
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

const UserProfile = () => {
	const { id } = useParams();

	return (
		<div>
			<h2>User Profile</h2>
			<p>User ID: {id}</p>
		</div>
	);
};

export default UserProfile;
```

- useLocation : he useLocation hook is provided by React Router v6 to access the current location object, which represents the current URL. It returns an object with properties such as pathname, search, hash, state, and key.

[EXAMPLE]

```js
import React from "react";
import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";

const MyComponent = () => {
	const location = useLocation();

	return (
		<div>
			<h2>Current Location</h2>
			<p>Pathname: {location.pathname}</p>
			<p>Search: {location.search}</p>
			<p>Hash: {location.hash}</p>
			{/* You can also access the state property if you passed state using the navigate method */}
			{/* <p>State: {location.state && JSON.stringify(location.state)}</p> */}
		</div>
	);
};

export default MyComponent;
```

- pathname represents the path of the current URL.
- search represents the query parameters of the current URL.
- hash represents the hash fragment of the current URL.
- state represents any state that might have been passed to the current location object (if applicable).

* useRoutes : In React Router v6, useRoutes is a hook that allows you to define nested routes dynamically based on a configuration object. It's useful for more complex routing setups where you want to programmatically define routes.

[EXAMPLE]

```js
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, useRoutes } from "react-router-dom";

const routes = [
	{
		path: "/",
		element: <Home />,
		children: [
			{ path: "about", element: <About /> },
			{ path: "contact", element: <Contact /> },
		],
	},
	{ path: "dashboard/*", element: <Dashboard /> },
];

function App() {
	const routing = useRoutes(routes);

	return <Router>{routing}</Router>;
}

export default App;
```

- The routes array contains an array of route objects. Each route object has a path property representing the URL path, an element property representing the component to render when the route matches, and optionally a children property for nested routes.
- The useRoutes hook is called with the routes array to generate the routing configuration.
- The routing variable returned from useRoutes is then rendered within the <Router> component.

* Dynamic Routing : You can generate routes dynamically based on conditions or data.
  [EXAMPLE]

```js
const items = [
	{ id: 1, name: "Item 1" },
	{ id: 2, name: "Item 2" },
	{ id: 3, name: "Item 3" },
];

const routes = items.map((item) => ({
	path: `item/${item.id}`,
	element: <ItemDetail item={item} />,
}));
```

- This will generate routes like /item/1, /item/2, /item/3, etc., each rendering the ItemDetail component with the corresponding item.

* Redirects and Not Found Routes : You can also include redirects and not found routes in the routes array
  [EXAMPLE]

```js
const routes = [
	{ path: "/", element: <Home /> },
	{ path: "about", element: <About /> },
	{ path: "contact", element: <Contact /> },
	{ path: "dashboard/*", element: <Dashboard /> },
	{ path: "login", element: <Login /> },
	{ path: "profile", element: <Profile />, authRequired: true },
	{ path: "logout", element: <Logout /> },
	{ path: "*", element: <NotFound /> },
];
```

- The '\*' path matches any route that hasn't been matched by previous routes, serving as a catch-all for not found routes.
- You can also conditionally render certain routes based on authentication status or other conditions, as shown with the authRequired property.

## Lecture 05 - CSS Structure & React Icons

---

![Alt text](IMG_0D7C05C293DC-1-1.jpeg)

1. CSS structure
   [src/App.jsx]

```js
function Layout() {
	return (
		<div className="flex flex-col h-screen justify-between">
			<NavBar />
			<main className="mb-auto w-10/12 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
				<Outlet />
			</main>
			<Footer />
		</div>
	);
}
```

2. React Icons

- npm install react-icons
  [src/Footer]

```js
import React from "react";
import { AiOutlineSmile } from "react-icons/ai";

const Footer = () => {
	//change
	return (
		//style
		<div className="flex h-20 text-lg justify-center items-center">
			All right reserved.
			<AiOutlineSmile />
		</div>
	);
};

export default Footer;
```

## Lecture 06 - Redux & Redux-Persist

---

- Prepare for using Redux

1. npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

- Redux Toolkit provides utilities to simplify Redux development, and React Redux allows you to connect your React components with the Redux store.

2. [src/store/userSlice.js]

```js
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const initialState = {
	userData: {
		id: "",
		email: "",
		name: "",
		role: 0,
		image: "",
	},
	isAuth: false,
	isLoading: false,
	error: "",
};

const userSlice = createSlice({
	name: "user",
	initialState,
	reducers: {},
	extraReducers: (buider) => {},
});

export default userSlice.reducer;
```

This file defines a Redux slice using createSlice from Redux Toolkit.
It sets the initial state for the user slice, including userData, isAuth, isLoading, and error.
The reducers and extraReducers sections are currently empty. They would contain reducer functions and extra reducers for handling actions and updating the state.

3. [src/store/index.js]

```js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import userReducer from "./userSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
	reducer: {
		user: userReducer,
	},
});
```

This file creates the Redux store using configureStore from Redux Toolkit.
It imports the user reducer from userSlice.js.
The user reducer is added to the store under the key user.

4. [src/main.jsx]

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.jsx";
import "./index.css";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "./store";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
	<BrowserRouter>
		<Provider store={store}>
			<App />
		</Provider>
	</BrowserRouter>
);
```

This file is the entry point of your React application.
It sets up the Redux store to be provided to all components using the Provider component from React Redux.
The <BrowserRouter> component wraps the entire application, enabling React Router functionality.
ReactDOM.createRoot().render() method is used to render the root component (<App />) into the HTML element with the id "root". This is the modern approach for rendering in React 18 and above.

- Redux-Persist
- Redux Persist is a library that helps persist the Redux state to the local storage or any other storage mechanism. It's commonly used in Redux applications, especially in combination with React, to maintain the state even after a page refresh or when the user navigates away from the application.

1. npm install redux-persist
2. [src/store/index.js]

```js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import userReducer from "./userSlice";
import storage from "redux-persist/lib/storage";
import {
	FLUSH,
	REHYDRATE,
	PAUSE,
	PERSIST,
	PURGE,
	REGISTER,
	persistReducer,
	persistStore,
} from "redux-persist";

// Combine all the reducers into one rootReducer.
export const rootReducer = combineReducers({
	user: userReducer, // Add the userReducer to the rootReducer.
});

// Configuration object for redux-persist.
const persistConfig = {
	key: "root", // Key for the persisted data in storage.
	storage, // Storage engine to use (default storage in this case).
};

// Create a persisted reducer using the persistConfig and rootReducer.
const persistedReducer = persistReducer(persistConfig, rootReducer);

// Configure the Redux store with the persisted reducer and customized middleware.
export const store = configureStore({
	reducer: persistedReducer, // Use the persisted reducer.
	middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
		getDefaultMiddleware({
			serializableCheck: {
				ignoreActions: [FLUSH, REHYDRATE, PAUSE, PERSIST, PURGE, REGISTER],
			},
		}),
});

// Create a persistor object for the store.
export const persistor = persistStore(store);
```

3. [src/main.jsx]

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.jsx";
import "./index.css";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { persistor, store } from "./store";
import { PersistGate } from "redux-persist/integration";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
	<BrowserRouter>
		<Provider store={store}>
			<PersistGate loading={null} persistor={persistor}>
				<App />
			</PersistGate>
		</Provider>
	</BrowserRouter>
);
```

## Lecture 07 - Backend simple setting

---

1. npm init
2. npm install express
3. npm install -D nodemone

- express : Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of creating a server and handling requests and responses.

- nodemon : Nodemon is a utility that helps develop Node.js applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. It is a tool that significantly enhances the developer experience by eliminating the need to manually stop and restart the server every time you make changes to your code.

4. When you send an API request from the client side to the backend, it is received in an entry file called index.js.

[backend/src/index.js]

```js
const express = require("express");

//constants
const PORT = 4000;
const app = express();

//Showing on localhost:4000
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
	res.send("Hello, World!");
});

//Mark on Terminal
app.listen(PORT, () => {
	console.log("PORT is running on 4000 now.");
});
```

5. Diretories structure
   src/middleware/auth.js
   /models/User.js
   /routes/users.js
   uploads
   .env
   .gitignore

6. npm install bcryptjs cors dotenv jsonwebtoken mogoose

7. bcryptjs
   bcryptjs is a library used for hashing passwords in a secure way. It provides methods to create hashes and to compare a given password with its hash. This is useful for storing passwords securely in a database.

8. cors
   cors (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a middleware used in Express.js applications to enable or restrict requested resources on a web server depending on where the HTTP request was initiated. It is used to allow or deny cross-origin requests.

9. dotenv
   dotenv is a module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. This is useful for managing configuration settings separately from the source code.

10. jsonwebtoken
    jsonwebtoken is a library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWTs are commonly used for authentication and secure data exchange.

11. mongoose
    mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data.

## Lecture 08 - express.static()

---

- The express.static() function is a built-in middleware function in Express.js that serves static files, such as HTML files, images, CSS files, and JavaScript files. This middleware is useful for serving assets that do not change dynamically, allowing you to deliver these files to the client's browser directly.

[backend/src/index.j]

```js
const express = require("express");
const path = require("path");

//constants
const PORT = 4000;
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
	res.send("Hello, World!");
});

//Use absolute paths to be accessible from any path
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "../uploads")));

app.listen(PORT, () => {
	console.log(`PORT is running on ${PORT}now.`);
});
```

## Lecture 09 - cors

---

- CORS : CORS, which stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control how web applications interact with resources from different origins. It helps prevent potentially malicious websites from accessing resources on another domain without permission.

- How CORS Works
  When a web application makes a request to a resource from a different origin (domain, protocol, or port), the browser will first send an HTTP request known as a "preflight" request. This preflight request uses the HTTP method OPTIONS and checks if the actual request is safe to send. The server's response to this preflight request includes specific headers that indicate whether the actual request is allowed.

- Key Concepts

* Same-Origin Policy (SOP): A security measure that restricts how documents and scripts loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin. CORS relaxes this restriction under specific conditions.
* Preflight Request: A CORS request made with the OPTIONS method to determine whether the actual request is safe to send.
* Access-Control-Allow-Origin: A response header that specifies which origins are allowed to access the resource.

[backend/src/index.js]

```js
const cors = require("cors"); //add

app.use(cors()); // add
```

## Lecture 10 - Express.json()

---

- Express.json() : What is express.json()?
  express.json() is a middleware function in Express.js that parses incoming request bodies in JSON format. This functionality has been built into Express since version 4.16.0 and replaces the need for the body-parser module.

- Key Concepts

* JSON Parsing: The express.json() middleware automatically parses the request body as a JSON object when the Content-Type header is set to application/json, and stores it in req.body.
* Middleware Usage: Using app.use(express.json()) allows JSON body parsing for all routes. For specific routes, you can apply it directly.

[backend/src/index.js]

```js
app.use(express.json()); //add

//example
app.post("/", (req, res) => {
	console.log(req.body);
	res.json(req.body);
});
```

- Why JSON Body Parsing is Necessary

* RESTful API: RESTful APIs often exchange data in JSON format. When a client sends JSON data to the server, the server needs to parse and use it.
* Data Processing: To process or store data in a database, the server needs to convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.

* express.json() is a useful middleware that automatically parses JSON formatted request bodies, making it easier to handle JSON data in Express applications. It plays an essential role in modern web applications, especially when dealing with RESTful APIs that process JSON data.

## Lecture 11 - MongoDB & Mongoose

---

- MondoDB : MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed to handle large volumes of data, scale out easily, and provide high availability. Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, MongoDB uses collections and documents to manage data, allowing for a more flexible schema design.

* Key Features of MongoDB

1. Document-Oriented Storage: Stores data as JSON-like documents.
2. Schema Flexibility: Documents in the same collection can have different fields.
3. Scalability: Easily scales out horizontally using sharding.
4. High Availability: Supports replication for data redundancy and failover.
5. Powerful Query Language: Rich query language for filtering and manipulating data.
6. Indexing: Supports various types of indexes to improve query performance.

- Basic MongoDB Concepts

* Database: A container for collections.
* Collection: A group of MongoDB documents, similar to a table in relational databases.
* Document: A single record in a collection, represented in BSON format.
* Field: A key-value pair in a document.

- Mongoose : Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. Mongoose manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

* Key Features of Mongoose

1. Schema Definition: Mongoose allows you to define schemas for your collections, specifying the structure of the documents.
2. Validation: You can define custom validation rules for your schemas to ensure data integrity.
3. Middleware: Mongoose supports middleware (also known as pre and post hooks) for various lifecycle events, such as saving or deleting documents.
4. Type Casting: Automatically converts data types to match your schema.
5. Query Building: Provides a more readable and chainable API for building queries.
6. Plugins: Mongoose has a flexible plugin system to extend its capabilities.

Connect MongoDB with Server

1. npm install mongoose
2. [backend/src/index.js]

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose"); //add
const dotenv = require("dotenv"); //add

dotenv.config(); //add

mongoose
	.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI)
	.then(() => {
		console.log("connect success");
	})
	.catch((err) => {
		console.log(err);
	});
```

## Lecture 12 - Create Model & Schema

---

- Model : A model is a compiled version of the schema. It provides the interface to interact with the database, enabling you to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) documents within the MongoDB collection that the model represents.

* Key Points about Model

- Instance Creation: Allows you to create instances of documents.
- CRUD Operations: Provides methods to perform CRUD operations.
- Querying: Enables querying the database with various conditions and filters.
- Instance Methods: Uses methods defined on the schema for document instances.
- Static Methods: Uses static methods defined on the schema for the model itself.

- Schema : In Mongoose (and many other ODM/ORM libraries), a schema is a blueprint or a structure for defining the shape and structure of documents within a MongoDB collection. It outlines the fields and their types, as well as validation rules, default values, and other configurations for the data.

* Key Points about Schema

- Structure: Defines the fields and types of data to be stored in a collection.
- Validation: Specifies validation rules to ensure data integrity.
- Defaults: Can set default values for fields if none are provided.
- Indexing: Allows you to create indexes to optimize query performance.
- Methods: Can define custom instance methods for documents.
- Stat: Can define static methods for the model.

1. Create Schema

[backend/src/models/User.js]

```js
const { default: mongoose } = require("mongoose");

//Schema
const userSchema = mongoose.Schema({
	name: {
		type: String,
		maxLength: 50,
	},
	email: {
		type: String,
		trim: true,
		unique: true,
	},
	password: {
		type: String,
		minLength: 5,
	},
	role: {
		trype: Number,
		default: 0,
	},
	image: String,
});

const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema); //model

module.exports = User; //export for using
```
